# Deployment Guide - Code Quality Automation Suite

This guide covers deploying Code Quality Automation Suite to production environments.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Production environment variables configured

#### Steps
1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
docker build -t app-name .
   ```

2. **Configure production environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with production values
   ```

3. **Deploy with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

### Option 2: Traditional Deployment

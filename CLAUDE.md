# Code Quality Automation Suite - Claude AI Assistant Guide

This file contains context and instructions for Claude Code to assist with this project.

## Project Overview

**Project**: Code Quality Automation Suite
**Description**: Comprehensive software engineering platform that automates code review, testing, deployment, and quality assurance processes.
**Technology Stack**: Node.js + React + TypeScript
**Complexity**: complex

## Architecture

This is a Node.js + React + TypeScript application with the following key components:

### Features
- **User Authentication** (high priority): Secure user registration and login system
- **API Documentation** (medium priority): Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- **Data Validation** (high priority): Input validation and sanitization
- **Rate Limiting** (medium priority): API rate limiting and throttling
- **Automated Testing** (high priority): Comprehensive test generation and execution framework
- **Code Quality Analysis** (high priority): Static analysis and code quality assessment tools
- **Code Documentation** (medium priority): Automatic documentation generation and maintenance
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (medium priority): Automated build, test, and deployment workflows
- **Error Handling** (high priority): Robust error handling and logging system
- **Monitoring Dashboard** (medium priority): Real-time monitoring and analytics

### Technology Stack
- Node.js 20.x (backend): Modern JavaScript runtime with excellent ecosystem
- TypeScript 5.x (backend): Type safety and enhanced developer experience
- React 18.x (frontend): Modern UI framework with excellent ecosystem
- Express.js 4.x (backend): Fast and minimalist web framework
- PostgreSQL 16 (database): Robust relational database with advanced features
- Prometheus 2.x (monitoring): Metrics collection and monitoring
- Jest 29.x (testing): Comprehensive testing framework
- Docker 24.x (devops): Containerization for consistent deployments

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Line length: 100 characters maximum
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces

### Testing Strategy
- Use Jest for testing framework
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use supertest for API testing
- Mock external dependencies in tests

### Common Tasks

When working on this project, you should:

1. **Running the Application**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations (if applicable)
npm run migrate

# Start the application
npm run dev
   ```

2. **Running Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
   ```

3. **Database Operations**:
   Database management commands

4. **Adding New Features**:
   - Create feature branch
   - Implement feature following existing patterns
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Update documentation
   - Submit pull request

### File Structure
Project structure description

### Configuration
- Environment variables are defined in `.env` (copy from `.env.template`)
- Application configuration is centralized in the config module
- Database settings, API keys, and service URLs are environment-based

### Security Considerations
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Authentication and authorization are implemented
- Environment variables are used for sensitive data
- HTTPS is enforced in production

## AI Assistant Instructions

When asked to help with this project:

1. **Always maintain consistency** with the existing codebase patterns
2. **Follow the established architecture** and don't introduce conflicting patterns
3. **Include comprehensive tests** for any new code
4. **Update documentation** when making significant changes
5. **Consider security implications** of any modifications
6. **Validate environment setup** before making changes

### Useful Commands for Development
